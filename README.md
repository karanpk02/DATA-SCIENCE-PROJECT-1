GUVI DATA SCIENCE PROJECT ON DEMAND FORECASTING
***********************************************
##**About Project**

Demand forecasting of sales dataset that contain multiple(25) items sold in 10 stores corresponding to each days over 4 
year period(2013-01-01 to 2017-12-31). Here our ML model will forecast the item demand for next year(2018-01-01 to 2018-03-31).
This will help the manufacturers to maintain appropriate stock which results in reduction in loss due to product not being sold and also reduces the opportunity cost.
